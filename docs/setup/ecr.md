# ECR

### 🏗️ This page is under construction.

We're still learning the best practices for integrating and using Net with ECR, for now see [Other Setups](/docs/setup/other.md) for integrating Net into other game architectures that don't use Matter. You can also see the [Matter Setup](/docs/setup/matter.md) to see how you would setup and use Net for another ECS library.

You can also checkout [ECR — A Luau ECS library](https://github.com/centau/ecr).
