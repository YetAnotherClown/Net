# Routes

Routes are the core component of Net, these objects are how you send or receive data through Net.
These are uniquely identified and come with no overhead, so you're encouraged to create as many as you need as if you were creating individual RemoteEvents.

## Configuration

There are a few ways you can configure your Routes:
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="channel" label="Channel" default>
  <p>
  All Routes run on one of two channels: Reliable & Unreliable.<br />
  These channels change the way your packets are sent over the network.
  </p>

  | Channel | Description |
  | ------- | ----------- |
  | Reliable | Packets are never dropped, and are always ordered. |
  | Unreliable | Packets may be dropped per frame, but are always ordered per frame. |
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="event" label="Event">
    <p>
    The <code lang="lua">Event</code> field is only used when you're using the Matter ECS.<br />
    This is used internally in the <code lang="lua">Net.start(loop, 	&#123; routes &#125;)</code> hook to schedule your Routes.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can safely ignore this field if you do not use the <code lang="lua">Net.start(loop, 	&#123; routes &#125;)</code> hook.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="middleware" label="Middleware">
    <p>
    Middleware is a powerful feature that allows you to validate your types and serialize/deserialize data before Packets are sent/queried.<br />
    There is a lot to say and go into detail about for Middleware, see <a href="/docs/getting-started/middleware">Getting Started with Middleware</a> for more.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Type-checking

Routes can be Type-checked to provide intellisense and auto-completion by providing a type annotation when creating your Routes.

```lua
local Net = require("Net.luau")
type Net<U...> = Net.Net<U...>

local Route: Net<number, string, boolean> = Net.new()
```

In this example, the Route is annotated with the types `number, string, boolean`, this means that our methods like `Route:query()` and `Route:send()` will return or expect
these types. E.g, `Route:send(number, string, boolean)` or `for _, _, number, string, boolean in Route:query() do`.

This will enable auto-completion and type-checking when working with your Routes, as such it is encouraged you enable Strict Typing to compliment these features.

## Sending

You can use `Route:send(...data)` to send data over the Route. This data will be processed next frame, which is when you'll be able to query it on the receiving end.

```lua
local Net = require("Net.luau")
type Net<U...> = Net.Net<U...>

local Route: Net<number, string, boolean> = Net.new()

Route:send(5, "Hello, world!", true)
```

By default, `Route:send()` will send the Packet of data to all Clients when used on the Server. You can specify a `Player` or `{ Player }` to send it to by using `Route:send():to(recipient)`.

## Querying

Querying is simple, you can query for Packets by using `Route:query()` which will return an iterator that will output `position, sender, ...data` in your for loop.

```lua
local Net = require("Net.luau")
type Net<U...> = Net.Net<U...>

local Route: Net<number, string, boolean> = Net.new()

for pos, sender, num, str, bool in Route:query() do
  -- Do something
end
```

When you call the `query` method, it will take a snapshot of all Packets from the previous frame and filter it for you, such as only returning Packets from the Route the method was called on.
Or, you can also filter out senders by calling `Route:query():from(...sender)` on the QueryResult and putting any values of type `{ Player } | Player | Net.Server` in the arguments.
